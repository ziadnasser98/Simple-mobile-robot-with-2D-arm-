# Simple-mobile-robot-with-2D-arm-

## Overview
This repository contains a description of a simple differential mobile robot as urdf files. The robot has a 2-DOF revolute manipulator and a camera. Special plugins were implemented to allow the robot to control the robot's and the manipulator's motion.
